# Kinda Funny Soundboard data
The Kinda Funny Soundboard app is an old fan made project created for the Kinda Funny community to enjoy. It plays audio clips of the early years of Kinda Funny, and allows anyone to set a clip as a ringtone or notification. The feedback was amazing and it was very popular.

Life has gotten in the way of my old fan made projects and I don't have time to maintain this app, but I feel like the community is owed an up to date and badass app.

## Opening the app content up to the community
So I'm now releasing the data bundle that is used to control the apps content. This includes the images and audio clips that I created from Kinda Funny content back in the day. This means that ANYONE from the community is entitled to download this bundle and use for whatever purpose they want.

## Make the app better!
Just because I don't have time to do the work necessary to maintain this project doesn't mean that the work can't be done. If you have any audio clips to contribute, or any images, or even any new people to be added... Pull this project down and add the content!

## How to add content
* Pull the repo
* Copy the content you want to add from your computer to the appropriate folders (and make sure they follow the naming standard of the folder)
* Open the sqllite database in your favourite database manager. I suggest using [https://sqlitebrowser.org/](DB Browser for SQLite)
Add the content that you want to add to the appropriately named tables. Make sure you get the clip titles and image names correct, or your changes won't work!

## Testing your changes
To be completed...
